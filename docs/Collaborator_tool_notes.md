# Pickled data

Summary:
* Data is based on results from assembly of all target genomes, identification of "functional domains", and comparison of differences between:
  * Genomes from a single species
  * Functional domains across multiple species

# Comparing binary trees


Questions:
* When creating my own binary trees:
  * Does the order of the nodes matter when specifying the membership for each tree?
  * In our case, we should theoretically be testing for differences in tree topology and not necessarily it's membership since we expect most genomes to be present in both analysis (results from different tools).
