* NCBI pathogen database
  * isolate browser
    * limit to 10k rows
    * multiple metadata variables for closely-releated categories (e.g. cattle, cow, bovine, bovid, etc)
  * metadata files
    * Divided by SNP group
    * A single assembly can be in multiple SNP groups
* Software tools
  * General take-aways
  * kSNP3
  * lyve-SET

    * The GUI works really well and allows for the selection of genomes from the NCBI database and WGS analysis with a single click.
    * Limited by requirement for the manual entry of genome accessions
    * The python tools work well, but needs to be run with multiple commands to replicate the entire pipeline that runs on the GUI
