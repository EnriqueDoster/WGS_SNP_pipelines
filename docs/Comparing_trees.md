Comparing trees
* If an isolate fell into the same well-supported clade as outbreak isolates (node confidence value â‰¥70%), it was counted as a positive. Otherwise, it was counted as a negative. 
  * Positives that retrospectively agree with the outbreak investigation were counted as TP; otherwise, FN.
  * The target well-supported clade is defined as a having a confidence value >70% and being as complementary as possible for Sn and Sp for each tree.
  * Sn was calculated as TP/(TP+FN). 
  * Sp was calculated as TN/(TN+FP).
